## Mlfow (DataBricks)
- [Simplifying Model Management with MLflow](https://databricks.com/session_eu19/1-simplifying-model-management-with-mlflow)
- [mlfow](https://www.mlflow.org/) - an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles three primary functions: 1) tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results 2) packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production 3) managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models).

## Spark
- [Best Practices for Building and Deploying Data Pipelines in Apache Spark - Vicky Avison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WUIua-xjJA)
- [Waimak](https://github.com/CoxAutomotiveDataSolutions/waimak) - an open-source framework that makes it easier to create complex data flows in Apache Spark

## Data Versioning & Validation 
- [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) -  helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity by offering a unique approach to automated testing: pipeline tests. Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead of compile or deploy time). Pipeline tests are like unit tests for datasets: they help you guard against upstream data changes and monitor data quality.
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/) - is built to make ML models shareable and reproducible. It is designed to handle large files, data sets, machine learning models, and metrics as well as code.
