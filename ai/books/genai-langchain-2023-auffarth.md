## Ch 1 - What is GenAI

algorithims than can generate novel content vs. just predict

AI <- ML <- DL <- LLM
      ^--  LM<----<+

Modalities - inputs and outputs

Parameters - more parameters the greater capacity to capture relationships between words/phrases and `knowledge`

### Understanding LLMs

Goal is to predict next work/character/sentenice based on previous sequence 

Representation learning - a model learning its internal representations of raw data to perform a machine learning task, rather than relying only on engineered feature extraction

## Ch 2- LangChain for LLM Apps
