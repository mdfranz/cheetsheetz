### Great Expectations
- [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) -  helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity by offering a unique approach to automated testing: pipeline tests. Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead of compile or deploy time). Pipeline tests are like unit tests for datasets: they help you guard against upstream data changes and monitor data quality and https://greatexpectations.io/
