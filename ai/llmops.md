# Personal/Local LLMs
## Containerizing Open Source Models
Container-like deployment of models seems like a solved problem with [ollama](https://ollama.com/)

## Self-Hosting (aka "Air Gapped" LLMs) 
- [h2ogpt](https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt) - Query and summarize your documents or just chat with local private GPT LLMs using h2oGPT, an Apache V2 open-source project.
- [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI) - free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API thatâ€™s compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU.
