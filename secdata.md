- [Pinecone Threat Detection](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/it-threat-detection) - notebook shows how to use Pinecone's similarity search as a service to build an application for detecting rare events. Such application is common in cyber-security and fraud detection domains wherein only a tiny fraction of the events are malicious.
